Digital Ocean Go

This repo contains miscellaneous Go demos.

### hello
Use Martini to serve a Go application behind an Nginx server. Based on a [Digital Ocean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-martini-to-serve-go-applications-behind-an-nginx-server-on-ubuntu) that also contains info on setting up the Go environment with GVM. Note: this is the Go code only, the Nginx config is also required (see tutorial).

Updated to use Amber templates with [Martini-Amber](https://github.com/llun/martini-amber) based on another [tutorial](http://getting-started.md/guides/3-go-martini).

### chan
This is about the simplest channel code you can write. It doesn't do much.
